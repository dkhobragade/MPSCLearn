                        What is the difference between MPSC Prelims and Mains?

                    <p className="text-gray-600">
                        The Prelims is a screening test consisting of two
                        objective-type papers (MCQs). Only candidates who qualify in
                        the Prelims are eligible to appear for the Mains
                        examination, which is descriptive in nature and tests the
                        candidate's in-depth knowledge and analytical abilities.

                        selection for the Mains examination.
